# Data Structures and Algorithms

**Discussion Questions**

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

> The Big O notation (a measure of how well an operation scales) is how a developer should decide which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem.

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

> The solution is to give the control back to the Event Loop by using techniques such as asynchronous callbacks or promises.
