# Putting it all together

## [Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react)

1. What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

The idea behind the SRP is that every class, module, or function in a program should have one responsibility/purpose in a program.

[SOLID Definition-FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/solid-principles-single-responsibility-principle-explained/#:~:text=The%20Single%20Responsibility%20Principle%20(SRP,only%20one%20reason%20to%20change%22.&text=The%20class%20above%20violates%20the%20single%20responsibility%20principle.)

2. What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

A static build is a compiled version of a program which has been statically linked against libraries.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_build#:~:text=A%20static%20build%20is%20a,been%20statically%20linked%20against%20libraries.)

3. Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?



4. What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

"Does it change over time? Does the product need to show up for user input? Does your item need to be rerendered?" Conner

5. How can you identify where state needs to live?

I identify where state needs to live by creating a function that each component can use and update.


## [Higher-Order Functions](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#h_xxCc98lOBK)

1. What is a “higher-order function”?

"A Higher-Order function is a function that receives a function as an argument or returns the function as output."

[Understanding Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript](https://blog.bitsrc.io/understanding-higher-order-functions-in-javascript-75461803bad)

"A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments and/or returns a function as its result."

2. Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. 

3. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?

"It's returning a function m > n" Conner

4. Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.
