The first link is about how to make a website that can show and change information about a school. You can think of a website as a book that has many pages. Each page can have words, pictures, and buttons. You can use a computer program called Visual Studio to make the pages of your website. You can also use another program called Entity Framework Core to help you store and manage the information about the school, such as the students, teachers, and classes. Entity Framework Core can talk to another program called a database, which is like a big cabinet with many drawers and folders. You can put the information in the folders and label them with names. Then you can find them easily when you need them. You can also change the information or add new information whenever you want.

The second link is about what Entity Framework Core is and what it can do. Entity Framework Core is a program that helps you work with databases. Databases are programs that store and organize information for you. For example, if you have a lot of toys, you might want to put them in different boxes and label them with names, such as cars, dolls, puzzles, etc. Then you can find the toy you want easily when you play. Databases do the same thing, but with information instead of toys. Entity Framework Core helps you talk to databases using words and pictures that you understand, instead of numbers and symbols that databases understand. It also helps you make changes to the information in the databases without messing up anything.

The third link is about how to fill up your database with some information when you first make it. This is called data seeding. Data seeding is like planting seeds in a garden. When you plant seeds, you hope that they will grow into plants that you can use or enjoy later. When you seed data, you hope that the information will be useful or interesting for your website later. There are different ways to seed data in Entity Framework Core, such as putting the seeds in the soil, putting them in pots, or watering them yourself. Each way has its own advantages and disadvantages.

The fourth link is another way to make a website using Entity Framework Core. This way is called Razor Pages. Razor Pages is like making a scrapbook with pictures and stickers. You can use Visual Studio to make the pages of your scrapbook and decorate them with words, pictures, and buttons. You can also use Entity Framework Core to store and manage the information for your scrapbook, such as your name, birthday, hobbies, etc. You can also do things like sorting, filtering, paging, grouping, and changing the information in your scrapbook.
