## [Notes from Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset from OpenAI](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve/transcript?language=en)


*Having a growth mindset means believing that you can improve your abilities and intelligence through effort, strategy, and feedback. It is the opposite of having a fixed mindset, which means thinking that your talents and skills are fixed and cannot change. Having a growth mindset is important for many reasons.*

*First, having a growth mindset helps you overcome challenges and setbacks. When you face a difficult problem or make a mistake, you don’t give up or feel hopeless. Instead, you see it as an opportunity to learn and grow. You try different strategies, seek help from others, and persist until you succeed. You also learn from your failures and use them to improve your future performance.*

*Second, having a growth mindset motivates you to work hard and achieve your goals. When you have a growth mindset, you are not afraid of taking on new and challenging tasks. You are curious and eager to learn new things. You also set high standards for yourself and work hard to meet them. You don’t let external factors, such as grades or rewards, determine your self-worth. Instead, you value the process of learning and improving yourself.*

*Third, having a growth mindset fosters positive relationships with others. When you have a growth mindset, you are more likely to collaborate with others, share your ideas, and give and receive constructive feedback. You are also more likely to appreciate the diversity of perspectives and abilities among people. You don’t judge yourself or others based on fixed traits, such as intelligence or talent. Instead, you recognize that everyone can grow and contribute in different ways.*

*The content above provides some examples of how having a growth mindset can lead to remarkable outcomes in education, especially for students who face disadvantages or stereotypes. It also shows how we can cultivate a growth mindset in ourselves and others by changing the way we think and talk about abilities and learning. By using words like “yet” or “not yet”, we can convey the message that we are on a journey of growth and that we can overcome any obstacles with effort and support.*

*Having a growth mindset is not only beneficial for individuals, but also for society as a whole. It can help us create more inclusive, innovative, and productive communities that value learning and growth for everyone.*

&nbsp;

**Summary:**

*A growth mindset is the belief that you can improve your abilities and intelligence through effort, strategy, and feedback. It helps you overcome challenges, achieve your goals, and build positive relationships. It also leads to remarkable outcomes in education, especially for disadvantaged or stereotyped students. You can develop a growth mindset by changing the way you think and talk about abilities and learning. A growth mindset is good for you and for society.*

**Cooking Analogy:**

*A growth mindset is like being a chef who is always willing to try new recipes, ingredients, and techniques. You don’t think that your cooking skills are fixed and limited by your talent or experience. You believe that you can improve your cooking skills by practicing, learning from others, and experimenting with different dishes. You don’t give up when you encounter a problem or make a mistake in the kitchen. Instead, you see it as a chance to learn and improve your cooking. You also enjoy sharing your food with others and getting feedback on how to make it better. You appreciate the diversity of tastes and preferences among people and respect their opinions. You don’t judge yourself or others based on how good or bad they are at cooking. Instead, you recognize that everyone can grow and contribute in different ways.*

*A growth mindset can help you become a better chef and a better person. It can also help you create more delicious, creative, and healthy food for yourself and others.*

## [Alain de Botton on Redefining Success Summary from ChatGPT](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success)

**Architectural Analogy:**

*The speaker, Alain de Botton, compares the modern society’s obsession with success and achievement to a skyscraper that dominates the skyline and casts a shadow over the rest of the buildings. He argues that this skyscraper represents a narrow and rigid definition of success that is based on material wealth, fame and power, and that it creates anxiety and envy for those who are not at the top. He suggests that we should rethink our idea of success and build a more diverse and humane cityscape, where different kinds of achievements are valued and respected, such as kindness, creativity, wisdom and service. He also urges us to be more compassionate towards ourselves and others when we fail or struggle, and to recognize that success is not always in our control, but depends on factors such as luck, opportunity and circumstance. He concludes by saying that we can find more fulfillment and happiness by being true to our own talents and passions, rather than following the expectations and judgments of others.*

&nbsp;

**Gymnastics Analogy:**

*The speaker, Alain de Botton, compares the modern society’s obsession with success and achievement to a gymnastics competition where everyone is judged by the same standards and criteria. He argues that this competition represents a narrow and rigid definition of success that is based on external rewards, recognition and comparison, and that it creates stress and insecurity for those who are not the best. He suggests that we should rethink our idea of success and create a more diverse and inclusive gymnastics show, where different kinds of skills and styles are appreciated and celebrated, such as grace, flexibility, originality and expression. He also urges us to be more empathetic towards ourselves and others when we make mistakes or face difficulties, and to recognize that success is not always in our hands, but depends on factors such as chance, opportunity and context. He concludes by saying that we can find more satisfaction and joy by being authentic to our own abilities and interests, rather than following the rules and opinions of others.*
