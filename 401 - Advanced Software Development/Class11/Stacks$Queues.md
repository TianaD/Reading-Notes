Compare stacks and queues to different types of vending machines:

A stack is like a vending machine that dispenses items from the top, and the items are loaded from the top as well. The last item that is loaded is the first item that is dispensed. This is called the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. For example, if you load a stack of cups from the top, the last cup that you put on the stack will be the first cup that you take off the stack.

A queue is like a vending machine that dispenses items from the front, and the items are loaded from the back. The first item that is loaded is the first item that is dispensed. This is called the FIFO (First In First Out) principle. For example, if you load a queue of people waiting for a bus, the first person that gets in line will be the first person that gets on the bus.

Both stacks and queues are linear data structures, meaning that they store elements in a sequential order. However, they differ in how they access and manipulate those elements. Stacks and queues have different methods and properties, such as push, pop, peek, enqueue, dequeue, isEmpty, and length. These methods and properties are explained in more detail in the article [Stacks and Queues](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/stacks_and_queues.html).
