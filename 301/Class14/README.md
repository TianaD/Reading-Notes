# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## [That Time When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

During the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science, several significant events and trends occurred:

Rise of Personal Computers: In the 1980s, personal computers became more accessible and affordable, leading to their widespread adoption in households. However, marketing and advertising often targeted boys and men, associating computers with gaming and technical hobbies, which contributed to the perception that computing was a male-dominated field.

Gender Stereotypes: Society's prevailing gender stereotypes and biases portrayed computing and programming as more suitable for men. This perception was reinforced through media representation and societal expectations that often discouraged girls from pursuing technical interests or careers.

Educational Shifts: As computers became more prevalent, schools started introducing computer science courses. However, many of these courses were often offered in predominantly male environments or were seen as more suitable for boys. Lack of encouragement and support for girls in these settings further discouraged their participation.

Cultural and Social Factors: The tech industry and computing culture developed predominantly within male-dominated spaces. The early hacker and computer enthusiast communities were mostly male, which created an environment that might have felt unwelcoming or exclusionary to women.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

The fact that males had been playing on computers growing up matters because it contributed to the gender gap in computer science. When boys had early exposure to computers and technology, they had more opportunities to develop technical skills, gain familiarity with programming languages, and build confidence in using computers. This early advantage gave them a head start when it came to pursuing computer science education and careers. On the other hand, girls who lacked similar exposure or encouragement may have felt less confident or capable in pursuing computer science.

* In the early days of computer programming, many of the pioneers were women, and the number of women studying computer science was growing faster than men.

* In 1984, there was a significant decline in the percentage of women in computer science, while the share of women in other technical and professional fields continued to rise.

* The decline coincided with the rise of personal computers in U.S. homes, which were primarily marketed to men and boys. Computers were seen as toys and were associated with male interests.

* The narrative that computers were for boys became ingrained in the culture, defining who geeks were and creating a techie culture.

* Researcher Jane Margolis found that families were more likely to buy computers for boys, even if girls showed interest in computers.

* As personal computers became more common, computer science professors began assuming that students had grown up playing with computers at home, creating a gap for students, particularly women, who didn't have access to computers.

* The assumption that students had prior computer experience disadvantaged women who were starting from a lower level of familiarity.

* The lack of early exposure and experience with computers led to feelings of being behind and discouraged some women from pursuing computer science.

* However, some women, like Patricia Ordóñez, eventually returned to computer science and succeeded after finding mentors and overcoming initial setbacks.

## [Why diversity matters to your tech company](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/)

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

- Diversity efforts are most successful when they're driven by a commitment from company leaders. This includes understanding the importance of diversity, communicating its importance within the organization, and making strategic decisions that promote diversity and inclusion.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

- Diverse teams are often smarter and more creative. The different perspectives and experiences brought by diverse individuals can lead to more innovative problem-solving. Moreover, research indicates a strong correlation between diversity and positive financial outcomes. For instance, a 2011 study found that female representation in top management can lead to an increase of $42 million in firm value. Similarly, a 2003 study found racial diversity was tied to better financial performance in banks focused on innovation.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

- An example given in the article of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base involves YouTube. When the developer team, who were almost entirely right-handed, built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This example illustrates that having a diverse development team could have potentially prevented this issue, as the needs and perspectives of a wider range of users would have been taken into account during the development process.
