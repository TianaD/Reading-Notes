### What is a wireframe?

"Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product."

It's like writing an outline before drafting a writing. Or like programming before drawing elevations or floor plans.

### Wireframe examples

- paper and pencil/whiteboard

- paper-prototypes

- lastly, switch to software - for more detailed decisions

### Things to consider before you start wireframing

"...the decision to use online tools or to wireframe by hand, and the process used to get to from wireframe to code, is less related to the individual preference of the UX Designer, and much more related to what approach the particular situation requires. It depends largely on how much emphasis there is on visual design in a project, and how much uncertainty there is with respect to what is being designed."

## 6 Steps to make a wireframe

### Do your research

"Remember: [UX design is a process](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/the-ux-design-process-an-actionable-guide-to-your-first-job-in-ux/), and wireframing isn’t the first step in this process. Before you even think about picking up a pen and paper, you need to have covered the first two steps; namely understanding who your audience is by way of user research, detailing requirements, creating user personas and defining use cases, and complementing this with further competitor and industry research. What does that mean? That means carrying out analysis of similar product lines to your own, digging into [prevailing UX trends](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/ux-trends-for-2019/) and [best practises](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/ux-best-practices/), and, of course, reviewing your own internal design guidelines."

### Prepare your research for quick reference

"If you’re a mere mortal, you might struggle to both retain and recall all of that, so I recommend scribbling a cheatsheet with your business and user goals (your requirements), your personas, use cases, and perhaps some reminders of the coolest features you stumbled across in your competitor research. A few choice quotes from your audience might also help focus your attention on the user’s experience, which is—never forget—what you’re designing!"

### Make sure you have your **user flow** mapped out

### Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate

### Add some detail and get testing

### Start turning your wireframes into prototypes
