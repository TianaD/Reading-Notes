# Class 01


## We learned about Heading from [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

Ensure there is a space between the hash (#) and the text.

# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3
#### Heading level 4
##### Heading level 5
###### Heading level 6


### Paragraphs are created like this in Markdown:

No syntax is needed. 

Use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.


### Line Breaks

To create a line break or new line, end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

Happy Day    
Happy Day You Say

### Emphasis
#### Bold
Two asterisks (**) **surrounding** text with no spaces.

#### Italic
One asterisks (*) *surrounding* text with no spaces.

#### Bold and Italics
Three asterisks (***) ***surrounding*** text with no spaces.

### Blockquotes
To create a blockquote, add a greater than symbol (>) in front of a paragraph.
>This is living now.
>This is living now. 
>This is living now.

#### For blockquotes with ***multiple paragraphs***, add a greater than (>) on the blank lines between the paragraphs.
>Miss Polly had a Dolly
>
>Who was sick sick sick
>
>So she called for a doctor
>
>To be quick quick quick

#### For ***nested block*** quotes, Add two greater than symbols (>>) in front of the paragraph you want to nest.
>Jack and Jill
>Went up a hill
>>To fetch a pail
>of water

#### Blockquotes +
> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.

#### Best Practices
For compatibility, put blank lines before and after blockquotes.

The cat's in the cradle 

> and the silver spoon

little boy blue and the man in the moon.

### Lists
To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.
#### Ordered lists
Example 1  

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

Example 2  

1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third item
1. Fourth item

Example 3  

1. First item
8. Second item
3. Third item
5. Fourth item  

Example 4  

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. Indented item
    2. Indented item
4. Fourth item

##### Best Practices
CommonMark and a few other lightweight markup languages let you use a parenthesis ()) as a delimiter (e.g., 1) First item), but not all Markdown applications support this, so it isn’t a great option from a compatibility perspective. For compatibility, use periods only.


#### Unordered lists
To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*)*, or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

Example 1

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

Example 2

* First item
* Second item
* Third item
* Fourth item

Example 3

+ First item
+ Second item
+ Third item
+ Fourth item

Example 4

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
    - Indented item
    - Indented item
- Fourth item

### Lists +
To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab, as shown in the following examples.

#### Paragraphs

#### Blockquotes

#### Code Blocks

#### Lists

### Code
To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (`)`.

At the command prompt, type `house`.

#### Escaping Backticks
If the word or phrase you want to denote as code includes one or more backticks, you can escape it by enclosing the word or phrase in double backticks (``)``. 

``Use `code` in your Markdown file.``

It's like having quotes inside of a quote (i.e. "Mr. Peter said, 'Go away!'").


#### Code Blocks

To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab.

    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
    </html>

### Horizontal Rules

To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***)***, dashes (---), or underscores (___)___ on a line by themselves.

***

---

_________________

#### Best Practices

For compatibility, put blank lines before and after horizontal rules.

Try to put a blank line before...

---

...and after a horizontal rule.
