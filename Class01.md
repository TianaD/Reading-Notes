# Class 01

## We learned about Heading from [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

Ensure there is a space between the hash (#) and the text.

# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3
#### Heading level 4
##### Heading level 5
###### Heading level 6


### Paragraphs are created like this in Markdown:

No syntax is needed. 

Use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.


### Line Breaks

To create a line break or new line, end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

Happy Day    
Happy Day You Say

### Emphasis
#### Bold
Two asterisks (**) **surrounding** text with no spaces.

#### Italic
One asterisks (*) *surrounding* text with no spaces.

#### Bold and Italics
Three asterisks (***) ***surrounding*** text with no spaces.

### Blockquotes
To create a blockquote, add a greater than symbol (>) in front of a paragraph.
>This is living now.
>This is living now. 
>This is living now.

#### For blockquotes with ***multiple paragraphs***, add a greater than (>) on the blank lines between the paragraphs.
>Miss Polly had a Dolly
>
>Who was sick sick sick
>
>So she called for a doctor
>
>To be quick quick quick

#### For ***nested block*** quotes, Add two greater than symbols (>>) in front of the paragraph you want to nest.
>Jack and Jill
>Went up a hill
>>To fetch a pail
>of water

#### Blockquotes +
> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.

#### Best Practices
For compatibility, put blank lines before and after blockquotes.

The cat's in the cradle 

> and the silver spoon

little boy blue and the man in the moon.
