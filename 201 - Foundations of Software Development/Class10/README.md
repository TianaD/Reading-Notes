# [**What went wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong)

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

    - Syntax errors provide the source of the error

    - with a syntax error, the code will not run successfully while with a logic error, the code will but will yield inaccurate results

    > Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!

    > Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.


2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

        LOGIC ERRORS - I moved stuff around in my code; I reorganized lines of my code.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

    >At this point, the game should play through fine, however after playing through a few times you'll undoubtedly notice that the game always chooses 1 as the "random" number you've got to guess. Definitely not quite how we want the game to play out!

    >There's definitely a problem in the game logic somewhere — the game is not returning an error; it just isn't playing right.
