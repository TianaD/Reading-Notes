# **Growth Mindset**
## Preface lol :D  

Warning: Incoherence ahead! At the time I wrote the words on this page, I wondered, "Does this have to make sense?" With a mild case of sleep deprivation, it is a lot to think in coherent sentences using correct grammar *and* care about syntax. I assume this is more about understanding how to use markdown. ðŸ‘€ Therefore, this is not an instance to receive advance. Just take it for what it is. ðŸ˜‚

## Challenges
Having a growth mindset means to be intentional about improving areas of weakness.
It means to be open to various solution methodologies.

## Obstacles
It is being disciplined to work when it's time to work, play when it is time to play. It requires focus so that one is not distracted by things that will easily distract some.
As I and others have said, focus is almost as valuable if not more valuable than skill these days, because so many people are distracted. Even those with the capabilities are unable to hone in enough to complete any given task. We simply live our lives - distracted.  

Obstacles also known as the eat that frog method.
Eating the frog refers to completing tasks that seem daunting or unappealing. We choose to deter from engaging in tasks that we dread, or we think might be dreadful to complete. Moreover, the concept alludes to the idea that the longer we leave the frogs, they multiply. Also, they get bigger. Some tasks that was originally small, grows, getting larger and multiplies as we continue to procrastinate in completing them.   

> That is all I will say about the *Eat that Frog* phenomenon. 
Concerning motivation, it is overrated. Those who practice disciple will excel far past those who chase motivation to do things they need to do. I am not motivated to brush my teeth every day; however, I know the consequences of not brushing my teeth. That's on me if I choose not to. I will reap the consequences. Moreover, I choose to brush my teeth regardless of how I feel about it because I like the benefits of a clean mouth. Because I am disciplined to do it, it has become a habit. And I do not consider my feelings when it is time to do what is habitual.

## Criticism
Criticism should be constructive. Self-evaluate and conceptualize the opinions/thoughts of others. Take what is valid and trash what is not.

## Success of Others
Celebrate others! Those with a growth mindset understand that they are only in competition with themselves. Someone else's success does not take away from his/her own.
