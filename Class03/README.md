Version Control is something that allows users to view progressions of work after having been overridden. 

There are three types of Version Control:

### Local Version Control
"A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files."

### Centralized Version Control

Collaboration

"This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients. This streamlined the collaboration process (by eliminating the need to involve all local databases), allowed programmers to have more knowledge of team membersâ€™ activities with certain files, and gave administrators much more control over divvying up revision privileges."

### Distributed Version Control
"If a CVS goes down, collaborators cannot work with each other on a file or save changes and new versions...To prevent this type of catastrophic loss, a DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information."
