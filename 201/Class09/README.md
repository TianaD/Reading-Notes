"**Web forms** are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a website or application. Forms allow users to enter data..."

"A web form's HTML is made up of one or more **form controls** (sometimes called **widgets**), plus some additional elements to help structure the overall form â€” they are often referred to as **HTML** forms. The controls can be single or multi-line text fields, dropdown boxes, buttons, checkboxes, or radio buttons, and are mostly created using the *input* element, although there are some other elements to learn about too."

### [**Designing your form**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Your_first_form#designing_your_form)

Be sure to take a step back and try a mockup before writing any code. "Designing a quick mockup will help you to define the right set of data you want to ask your user to enter."

*Tip: Keep it simple and only ask for data that is necessary!*
