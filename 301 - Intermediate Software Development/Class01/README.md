# Introduction to React and Components

## [Component-Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

1. What is a “component”?
    - A set of well-defined functionalities. Components are intended to interact with each other. They encapsulate a function's implementation and exports it as a higher-level interface. They are modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable.

2. What are the characteristics of a component?
    - Reusability - designed to be used in different situations in different applications.
    - Replaceable - may be freely substituted w similar components.
    -Not Context Specific - designed to operate in different environments and contexts.
    - Extensible - can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.
    - Encapsulated - allows caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state
    - Independent - designed to have minimal dependencies on other components

3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
    - Ease of deployment and development, reduced cost, reusability, reliability, etc...
