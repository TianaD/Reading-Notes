This topic is important because I need to know the significance of working with colleagues and how to deal will challenges as they arise.

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

    * Approach work with a learning problem not an execution problem mindset. 

    * Have a growth mindset.

    * 

2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

I think in general this is a concern among people. This is why the announcement "there are no dumb questions" is often a preface when opening the floor for questions.

Additonally, I do not recall in detail a previous professional setting (or team) where psychological safety was an asset.


3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

Teams with a high degree of psychological safety exhibit "higher levels of performance and lower levels of interpersonal conflict."
