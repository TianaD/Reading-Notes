### Paragraphs are created like this in Markdown:

No syntax is needed. 

Use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.


### Line Breaks

To create a line break or new line, end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

Two asterisks (**) **surrounding** text with no spaces.

#### Italic
