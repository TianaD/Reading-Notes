# Class 01

## We learned about Heading from [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

Ensure there is a space between the hash (#) and the text.

# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3
#### Heading level 4
##### Heading level 5
###### Heading level 6


### Paragraphs are created like this in Markdown:

No syntax is needed. 

Use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.


### Line Breaks

To create a line break or new line, end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

Happy Day    
Happy Day You Say

### Emphasis
#### Bold
Two asterisks (**) **surrounding** text with no spaces.

#### Italic





#### This is how a ***link*** is created in markdown
