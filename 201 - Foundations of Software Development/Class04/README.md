## [**What is a hyperlink?**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks#what_is_a_hyperlink)

Here syntax for what makes a link is discussed. 

"Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address."

"Almost any web content can be converted to a link so that when clicked or otherwise activated the web browser goes to another web address (URL)."

So, it's how we link pages together...

## [**Anatomy of a link**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks#anatomy_of_a_link)

"A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an <a> element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address."

## [**Link best practices**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks#link_best_practices)

"There are some best practices to follow when writing links. Let's look at these now."

### [**Use clear link wording**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks#use_clear_link_wording)

Tips:

- Make Links accessible to all readers.

- "Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text"

- "Don't say "link" or "links to" in the link text — it's just noise."

- "Keep your link text as short as possible — this is helpful because screen readers need to interpret the entire link text."

- "Minimize instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places. This can cause problems for screen reader users, if there's a list of links out of context that are labeled "click here", "click here", "click here"."
