# **[Programming with JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow)**

## Control flow

"Control flow refers to the order in which a computer executes statements in a script."

"A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer. In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements."

*For example, if else statements are a conditional structure changing the outcome of the execution based on the user's interaction/input.*

When using control flow, consider program structure and how the order affects execution.

# **[JavaScript Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp)**

*"A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task."*

*"A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it)."*

&nbsp;

### **JavaScript Function Syntax**

&nbsp;

> A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
>
> Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
>
> The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
>(parameter1, parameter2, ...)
>
>The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

&nbsp;

*"Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition."*

*"Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked."*

*"Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables."*

&nbsp;

### **Function Invocation**

*"The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:"*

> - When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
>
> - When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
>
> - Automatically (self invoked)

&nbsp;

### **Function Return**

"When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing."


### **Why Functions?**

Functions allow us to define code, use it, and reuse it with different arguments to produce different results.

### **The () Operator Invokes the Function**

"Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result."

### **Functions Used as Variable Values**

"Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations."

### **Local Variables**

"Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function. Local variables can only be accessed from within the function."

"Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions."

"Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed."
