# Readings: Interfaces

## [Interfaces](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/interfaces)

"You define an interface by using the interface keyword as the following example shows."

```CSharp
interface IEquatable<T>
{
    bool Equals(T obj);
}
```

- The link is about interfaces in C#, which are a way to define a contract that specifies the capabilities or behaviors that a class or a struct can implement.
- Interfaces can contain methods, properties, events, and indexers, but they do not provide any implementation for them.
- Classes and structs can implement multiple interfaces, which allows for multiple inheritance in C#.
- Interfaces can also inherit from other interfaces, creating a hierarchy of related behaviors.
- The link provides an example of creating an interface called IAnimal that defines a method called MakeSound.
- The link also shows how to create classes that implement the IAnimal interface, such as Dog, Cat, and Bird.
- The link demonstrates how to use the is and as operators to check if an object implements an interface or to cast it to an interface type.
- The link explains how to use the default keyword to provide a default implementation for an interface member that can be overridden by the implementing class.
- The link also covers some advanced topics such as generic interfaces, variance, and explicit interface implementation.

```CSharp
public class Car : IEquatable<Car>
{
    public string? Make { get; set; }
    public string? Model { get; set; }
    public string? Year { get; set; }

    // Implementation of IEquatable<T> interface
    public bool Equals(Car? car)
    {
        return (this.Make, this.Model, this.Year) ==
            (car?.Make, car?.Model, car?.Year);
    }
}
```

## [Back to Basics](https://simpleprogrammer.com/back-to-basics-what-is-an-interface/)

- The link is about interfaces in programming, which are a way to define a set of behaviors or capabilities that a class can implement.
- Interfaces are useful for achieving abstraction, decoupling, and polymorphism in object-oriented programming.
- Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and exposing only the essential features of a system.
- Decoupling is the principle of reducing the dependencies between different components of a system.
- Polymorphism is the ability to treat objects of different types in a uniform way based on their common behaviors.
- The link provides an example of creating an interface called IAnimal that defines a method called Speak.
- The link also shows how to create classes that implement the IAnimal interface, such as Dog and Cat.
- The link demonstrates how to use an array of IAnimal references to store and manipulate objects of different types that implement the interface.
- The link explains how interfaces can be used to achieve multiple inheritance in languages that do not support it directly, such as C#.
- The link also covers some common scenarios where interfaces are used, such as dependency injection, mocking, and design patterns.

## [Interfaces #2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/interface)

- The link is about the interface keyword in C#, which is used to define a contract that specifies the capabilities or behaviors that a class or a struct can implement.
- An interface can contain declarations of methods, properties, indexers, events, and constants, but not their implementations.
- A class or a struct can implement multiple interfaces, which allows for multiple inheritance in C#.
- An interface can also inherit from other interfaces, creating a hierarchy of related behaviors.
- The link provides an example of creating an interface called ISampleInterface that defines a method called SampleMethod.
- The link also shows how to create a class that implements the ISampleInterface interface and how to call the interface member from an interface instance.
- The link explains how to use default interface members to provide a default implementation for interface members that can be overridden by the implementing class.
- The link also covers some advanced topics such as static abstract and virtual members, which allow an interface to declare that an implementing type must provide certain static members or operators.
